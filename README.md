## Title: Monster 1v1
Description: This simple game allows you to select a monster to fight. Once you select a monster the you fight it by using the lasers to hit the monster. Once the monster reaches no health, you win.
Running the project: Open the project in MakeCode and use the w, a, s, and d keys to control the player.
What I learned: This project taught me important skils of problem solving and debugging. It also taught me increadible patience since, at one point, github deleted all my code so I had to remake and rethink through my project. I also developed a deeper understanding of iteration in programs.
